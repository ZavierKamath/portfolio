- [ ] Click different navigation links
- [ ] Verify active route highlighting works
- [ ] Test hover effects on navigation links
- [ ] Check social media links open in new tabs

### Mobile Testing:
- [ ] Open browser dev tools, set to mobile viewport
- [ ] Verify hamburger menu appears
- [ ] Click hamburger - menu should slide in from right
- [ ] Click backdrop - menu should close
- [ ] Press Escape key - menu should close
- [ ] Navigate to different pages via mobile menu

## Implementation Details:

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js 15** - App Router for client-side navigation
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for all components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling with custom design tokens
- **React Hooks** - State management and lifecycle
- **CSS Transforms** - Hardware-accelerated animations

### Key Design Decisions:
- **Performance First**: Throttled scroll events, CSS transforms
- **Accessibility Built-in**: Keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with mobile menu
- **No Over-engineering**: Simple, maintainable code

### Animation Details:
- **Navbar Hide/Show**: 300ms ease-out transform
- **Mobile Menu**: 300ms slide-in with backdrop fade
- **Active Indicator**: Smooth width transition
- **Hover Effects**: 200ms color transitions

## Next Steps:
The navigation is now fully functional and ready for the next development phase. The scroll-aware behavior works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices, providing an excellent user experience that aligns with the astronomy-themed portfolio design.
